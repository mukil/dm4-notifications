# DMX Notifications

The DMX Notifications plugin makes it easy for developers to create persistent notifications across sessions and screens.

Important: There are several privacy-related issues unsolved (see https://git.dmx.systems/dmx-plugins/dmx-notifications/-/issues/10). The current version is experimental and released for DEMO purposes only. Furthermore, the type definition should not be used as a template for other plugins (see https://git.dmx.systems/dmx-plugins/dmx-notifications/-/issues/12). The latest version does not resemble the feature of the DM 4 version yet (see https://git.dmx.systems/dmx-plugins/dmx-notifications/-/issues/11).

The use case is:

A user subscribes a topic.
The user is notified when the topic is changed.  

Actually the plugin provides:
*   A *Notification* model (a Topic Type representing a _message_)
*   A *Subscription* model (an Association Type for the _configurations_)
*   A service to
    *    Manage subscriptions (subscribe/unsubscribe)
    *    Create notifications (persistent notifcations for all users who subscribed given item)


## Notifications Model

The following figure you find an overview of the type definitionst dmx-notifications installs in DMX.

## Usage: Subscribe items to receive notifications

A subscription is created using the "Subscribe" (resp. "Unsubscribe") context command on eligible topics.

### Accessing notifications (In-App) 

When logged in you find your notifications behind the Envelope-icon in the upper right corner of the window. A badge indicates your unread notifications.

## Requirements

DMX 5.1 is a platform for collaboration and knowledge management.
