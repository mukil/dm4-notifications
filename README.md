# DeepaMehta 4 Notifications

The DeepaMehta 4 Notifications plugin makes it easy for developers to create persistent notifications across sessions and screens. It furthermore takes care that the notifications end up in the recipients _Private Workspace_.

The use case is:

A user subscribes a topic.
The user is notified when the topic is changed.  

Actually the plugin provides:
*   A *Notification* model (a Topic Type for the _message_)
*   A *Subscription* model (an Association Type for the _configurations_)
*   A service to
    *    Manage subscriptions (subscribe/unsubscribe)
    *    Create notifications (persistent notifcations for all users who subscribed given item)

A subscription is created (using DeepaMehta's Webclient) through drawing an association of type `Notification Subscription` between a `Username` topic and a topic of type `Workspace`, `Topicmap` or `Note`. For example see the following screenshot.

![Notification Subscription Example: "admin" subscribed to three items](https://github.com/mukil/dm4-notifications/raw/master/docs/screen_a_notification_subscription_edge_75perc.png)

When logged in you can find all notifications for you after clicking on your username topic in the upper right corner of the DeepaMehta Webclient. Then, reveal the very first topic, the one which represents your actual _Username_ and you will see all _Notifications_ related to your username. All the notifications are accessible to you only and can therefore also be revealed through revealing your `Private Workspace`. Sorry for this inconvenience. Currently there is no other special display available to deliver the notifications to you in a more convenient way but, of course, you could help us design and create one :)
