# DMX Notifications

The DMX Notifications plugin makes it easy for developers to create persistent notifications across sessions and screens. It furthermore takes care that the notifications end up in the recipients _Private Workspace_.

The use case is:

A user subscribes a topic.
The user is notified when the topic is changed.  

Actually the plugin provides:
*   A *Notification* model (a Topic Type representing a _message_)
*   A *Subscription* model (an Association Type for the _configurations_)
*   A service to
    *    Manage subscriptions (subscribe/unsubscribe)
    *    Create notifications (persistent notifcations for all users who subscribed given item)


## Notifications Model

The following figure you find an overview of the type definitionst dmx-notifications installs in DMX.

## Usage: Subscribe items to receive notifications

A subscription is created (using the DMX Webclient) through creating a `Notification Subscription` association between your `Username` topic and a topic of type `Workspace`, `Topicmap` or `Note`. For example see the following screenshot.

![Notification Subscription Example: "admin" subscribed to three items](https://github.com/mukil/dmx-notifications/raw/master/docs/notification_subscription_configuration.png)

For the mentioned subscriptions the following actions will notify subscribers:
*   Workspace: Whenever a new *Topicmap*, *Note* or *Event* is created in the workspace
*   Topicmap: Whenever another user with write permission `adds a topic` to it
*   Note: Whenever another user with WRITE permissions `Edits` the contents of the note<br/>
    (In this case, the notificiation includes the old and the new contents of the topic, [example](https://github.com/mukil/dmx-notifications/blob/master/docs/screen_c_notification_topics_75perc.png))

### Accessing notifications (In-App) 

When logged in you find your notifications related to your username. You can reveal your username in a topicmap using the Search/Create Dialog. Related to your username you will find all your _Notifications_. You can navigate to your notifications also using the *Related* tab after revealing your `Private Workspace`.

As of DMX there is no special display (yet) which delivers you your notifications in a more convenient way. Of course, you're very welcome to encourage us or help us to design or create one :)

Your _Notifications_ are accessible and readable to you only (unless you move them to another workspace).
