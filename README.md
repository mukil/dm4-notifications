# DeepaMehta 4 Notifications

The DeepaMehta 4 Notifications plugin makes it easy for developers to create persistent notifications across sessions and screens. It furthermore takes care that the notifications end up in the recipients _Private Workspace_.

The use case is:

A user subscribes a topic.
The user is notified when the topic is changed.  

Actually the plugin provides:
*   A *Notification* model (a Topic Type for the _message_)
*   A *Subscription* model (an Association Type for the _configurations_)
*   A service to
    *    Manage subscriptions (subscribe/unsubscribe)
    *    Create notifications (persistent notifcations for all users who subscribed given item)

A subscription-edge (associating a user with a subscribed item) can have many subscription types (as child topics). The plugin developers conceived two basic subscription types in advance: `In-App` (delivery via dm4-websockets) and `Mail` (not yet implemented).
