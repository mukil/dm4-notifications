# DeepaMehta 4 Notifications

The DeepaMehta 4 Notifications plugin makes it easy for developers to create persistent notifications across sessions and screens. It furthermore takes care that the notifications end up in the recipients _Private Workspace_.

The use case is:

A user subscribes a topic.
The user is notified when the topic is changed.  

Actually the plugin provides:
*   A *Notification* model (a Topic Type for the _message_)
*   A *Subscription* model (an Association Type for the _configurations_)
*   A service to
    *    Manage subscriptions (subscribe/unsubscribe)
    *    Create notifications (persistent notifcations for all users who subscribed given item)

A subscription is created (using DeepaMehta's Webclient) through drawing an association of type `Notification Subscription` between a `Username` topic and a topic of type `Workspace`, `Topicmap` or `Note`. For example see the following screenshot.

![Notification Subscription Example: "admin" subscribed to three items](https://github.com/mukil/dm4-notifications/raw/master/docs/screen_a_notification_subscription_edge_860.png)

For the mentioned subscriptions the following actions will notify subscribers:
*   Workspace: Whenever a `New Topicmap` (which is not `Private`) is created in it
*   Topicmap: Whenever another user with write permission `adds a topic` to it
*   Note: Whenever another user with WRITE permissions `Edits` the notes content<br/>
    (while, in this case, the content before and after the edit is copied as content of the notifications)

### Accessing notifications (In-App) 

When logged in you can find all notifications for you after clicking on your username topic in the upper right corner of the DeepaMehta Webclient. Then, reveal the very first topic, the one which represents your actual _Username_ and you will see all _Notifications_ related to your username. Sorry for this inconvenience. Currently we have no special display which delivers you notifications in a more convenient way. But of course, you're very welcome to encourage us or help us to design or create one :)

Your _Notifications_ are accessible and readable to you only (unless you share them). For that reason you can find your notifications also in the related section after  revealing your `Private Workspace`.
